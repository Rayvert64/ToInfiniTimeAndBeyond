First thing's first, here is a copy of the most important part of the document, which is usually put at the end for whatever silly reason!

# Our Values
Here are the core values that should be respected! They are pretty neat if you ask me! It's not super long, and pretty easy to understand. At some points in this document you will notice that both "we" and "I" is used to create a more approachable and human tone. This is intentional: we(I) want to avoid the feeling of bureaucratic jargon or disingenuous language which is(in my opinion) often used as a "legal cover," kind of like "green-washing" if you are into the whole "save the planet thing." (Which I am, but some people are not.)

I want to make clear that people are allowed to make mistakes, and that most people are redeemable. Often some inappropriate people just need to be given a chance become better, but we must also accept that sometimes in a community if someone is hurt is done, there is no going back.

**You should know that this document is subject to change. There might be some things I have ethically missed, I(The person writing this) am only human after all!**

## Embracing snowflakes, but also... not... snowflakes?...:
We recognize that everyone has their own unique sensitivities, boundaries, and needs. It's okay to be a snowflake ‚Äì in fact, it's more than okay; it's human. And if someone is not a snowflake, a ...rock...flake(?), per-say, that person should not be dehumanized for having thicker skin!

## Respectful accommodations:
While we can't cater to every individual's needs all the time, we strive to be understanding and accommodating when possible. If you're a snowflake, we'll try our best to respect your boundaries and make you feel comfortable ‚Äì but also remember that others may not share your sensitivities.

## Life is grey, not black and white:
We find that this quote is a perfect analogy for the complexities of life. Just like pixels on a black-and-white screen, there are truths out there that exist in stark contrast. These are the black and white pixels, such as mathematical equations or physical laws, which can be clearly understood when examined closely. However, when viewed from a broader perspective, everything appears uniformly grey ‚Äì a nuanced representation of life's intricacies.

## Brazil
üáßüá∑ mentioned!

## Humanity over ego:
We prioritize being kind, empathetic, and understanding over being "right" or winning arguments. Remember, we're all in this together!

**THAT BEING SAID:** Someone *can* be right about something, and people should be ok being wrong. If someone has a hard time seeing that they are wrong; we should at least *try* leading people in the right direction rather than shunning them.

## Red Card, Yellow Card:
Here's an excerpt of a group of fellas I like, and I think they got a pretty good system:
<details>
<summary>The next excerpt in this dropdown, could be considered sensitive to some folks. Usually I would not censor this, but since this is a more sensitive document. I personally think it's funny!</summary>

```
‚Äê Wanna know what? Soccer's got a pretty good thing going with that card system, eh?

‚Äê The which?
‚Äê For the referees?

‚Äê Yeah. Like, if someone's being a dink, you give 'em a yellow card. It's like a warning card. Then if they keep being a tit, you give 'em a red card which means that tit's out.

‚Äê Mm.
‚Äê Out where?

‚Äê Like, out of the game. Like, you don't gotta deal with 'em anymore.

‚Äê Well, that's handy then.

‚Äê That's Handy Moore.

‚Äê It'd be Handy Orton.

‚Äê Could be Handy Roddick.

‚Äê It's Handy Patinkin.

‚Äê Well, how handy would that be if it was real life?

‚Äê Well, no doubt that'd be handy.

‚Äê It'd be Handy Newton.

‚Äê It'd be Handy Koufax.

‚Äê It'd be Handy Alomar Jr.

‚Äê It'd be Macho Man Handy Savage.

‚Äê It's like, we could weed out the tits, it'll give us more time to help real people. What's the problems?

‚Äê Well, yeah. And then we wouldn't have to deal with the tits.

‚Äê Yeah, yeah. So if ya gets a yellow card, it means stops being a dinks. And if you keeps being a dinks, you gets a red card which means you're out, ya tit!
```
</details>

```
This is the classic yellow-card/red-card system that you see in football(soccer): You get one warning before a yellow card, since mistakes are common. But if you start being a nuisance well, you know the rest.
```
**Some more egregious behavior can get you an automatic red card!**

--------------------
# Expected Behavior
![high_five](./doc/gifs/borat-high-five.gif)

Here's how we expect people to act. It's kinda depressing that this has to be stated in the first place...

Usually breaking the behaviors bellow are "yellow-card" worthy if done more than once, unless mentioned. Speaking of:

## Use humor responsibly:
If you're about to share something that could be considered to have a sensitive subject in the joke or comment, **prefix** your comment with "/s" (short for "sarcasm" or "warning: snarky remark ahead") so others know to take it lightly. This helps us avoid misunderstandings and keeps the vibes light. **YOU MUST PUT IT AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR COMMENT. Or else someone might read it and be triggered until they reach the end and see the "/s," in which case they HAVE already been triggered, and it kind of defeats the point of this rule.**

**Putting "/s" at the end is an automatic yellow card since you didn't bother reading this fun document I put so much prompt-I mean EFFORT into!**

## Be kind and respectful:
Treat others with empathy and understanding, even if you disagree with them. Avoid personal attacks, insults, or condescending language.

## Communicate openly and honestly:
Share your thoughts and feelings in a clear and respectful manner. Listen actively to others and try to understand their perspectives.

## Respect boundaries:
If someone expresses discomfort or asks for space, respect their wishes and give them room to breathe.

## Don't take yourself too seriously:
We're all human, and we all make mistakes. Learn to laugh at yourself and don't be afraid to admit when you're wrong.

## Have you seen *One Piece*?
I haven't.

<small>I hear it's good. :)</small>

## Engage in good-faith discussions:
Come to conversations with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Avoid trolling, baiting, or deliberately trying to provoke others.

Some additional notes on what this means in practice:
```
- If someone asks for a trigger warning(TW) or a content warning(CW) on a thread, please provide one if you're sharing potentially sensitive material. We will *try* making a tag for it, but it could be possible that, in a large thread, that some people might not see the TW/CW. Remember some people might just jump to a comment due to search engines.

- Try to avoid using language that might be hurtful or alienating to others, even if it's not intended that way. We're all coming from different places and experiences! If you do please tag it properly!

- If you see someone being bullied or harassed, speak up and support them! Or ask in the thread if that interaction was ok. We're a community, and we look out for each other, and if we do this long enough some might learn what jokes pass and what don't. It's a skill like any other after all!
```

----------------------
# Unacceptable Behavior
![Red Card](./doc/gifs/red_card.gif)

## Hateful speech:
Any form of hateful or discriminatory speech, including racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, or other forms of targeted harassment, will not be tolerated.

### But what if "/s?"
Listen I love making fun of bigotry, it's so incredibly dumb that I can never imagine anyone saying something *actually* bigoted... **SADLY THOUGH**, some people like to ruin my fun by being serious about it... so if bigotry happens, even with "/s":
```
Then the person(**OR GROUP**) receiving the insult will have a significant say in determining the fate of the person responsible. This means that they have the power of the Red Card, or Yellow Card if they feel merciful! To elaborate:
```
### Context and Intent are Not Excuses; they are Explanations, but not Excuses:
So to contextualize the header above: **An Excuse** is when you try to move the responsibility of your action to something else, in some cases this is valid. Like when you were late to work because your car exploded, that's a good excuse! **An Explanation** on the other hand, explains your behavior(duh), but the responsibility is still on you. For example: I really like messed up humor! I have probably done my fair share of horrible jokes, but I do them with people that I know won't be affected by them. But I don't use this as an excuse if someone hears me say that and feels offended! If you say/do something that could be considered terrible by someone, YOU MUST TRY TO ACCEPT THAT RISK AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH IT!

Having an explanation might help with being forgiven, but it won't guarantee it. A "sorry" doesn't fix anything that has already been done, but it can help the healing process.

### Said more professionally...

We understand that some individuals may attempt to use sarcasm or humor as an excuse for hateful speech. However, we also recognize that certain comments can have a significant impact on members of targeted demographics, even if they're intended as jokes. As such, we will not tolerate complaints about people feeling that a statement has gone too far, even if the complainant is not the one being targeted.

## Automatic Deletion
In cases where an insult or hateful comment is reported and the person who was targeted is unavailable to respond, the comment will be automatically deleted as promptly as possible.

Some additional notes on what this means in practice:

```
- Our community is built on a foundation of respect and empathy. We expect all members to uphold these values and treat each other with kindness and compassion.

- If you witness hateful speech or targeted harassment, please report it immediately to the moderators.

- Remember that everyone has different boundaries and triggers. Be considerate of others' feelings and avoid making jokes or comments that could be hurtful or alienating.
```

Remember that your safety and well-being are important. If we are going to take some risks by being a bit more lenient with jokes, then we should also take the time to help people what are in difficult situations. As a community we should help and want to ensure that our community remains a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone.

Please note that this is just a draft, and you may need to adjust it according to your specific community's needs and policies.
